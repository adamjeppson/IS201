                        <h4>Saturday May 17th, 2021 </h4>
                        <p>Ethan and I had been climbing together consistently for half a year when we attempted Scarface. From what I understand, he had been looking for a partner with three specific qualities: availability, willingness to suffer a bit for long, hard objectives, and hard trad climbing skills. At first, I only possessed two of these qualities. 2021 was my senior year of high school and, thanks to the pandemic, I had as much free time as I could ever want. I had already proven myself to be down for type 2 fun after the snow storm on The Nose. And, while I wasn’t climbing nearly as hard as Ethan, maybe he saw potential in me.                        </p>
                        <p>Our first few outings together followed the same pattern. Ethan would choose specific routes for me to try, often without supplying the grade of the route. Whenever I asked, he would just smile slyly and respond, “It’s five stars!” My chosen routes progressively became harder, with Ethan giving me tips after each route. Looking back on it, I can see how he was preparing me to tackle his harder objectives with him. Then one day, when I assume he deemed I was up to par, he said our next goal was Scarface on Liberty Cap.</p>
                        
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/scarface/fishCrack.jpg" alt="Whipping off what would later be my second 5.12, Ethan belaying" /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Whipping off what would later be my second 5.12 crack, Ethan belaying</span>

                        <p>I had never heard of it, but quickly became enthralled by the beauty of both the line itself and its surroundings. Liberty Cap sits just in between Half Dome and Nevada Falls, requiring a 3.5 mile jaunt up the ever-steepening granite staircase of the mist trail. As you near Nevada falls turn left off the trail, right where the old Snow Hotel used to be. It's a tough hike, and I had to ask Ethan to slow down quite a few times on our attempt. The route itself follows a lighter colored “scar” that was left behind after a rockfall in 1872, degrees stopping just short of crushing the Hotel.</p>

                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/scarface/LCapRockfall.jpg" alt="Historic photo of Snow Hotel, outlining the rockfall debris" /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Dashed line in upper left shows the 'scar', with dotted line below showing where rockfall debris stopped. The Snow Hotel survived by a small margin.  </span>


                        <p>Scarface consists of 12 pitches and another 300ft of scrambling to the summit. After 4 pitches of introductory climbing, you reach the first 5.12 crux; Fifteen feet of easy ground gives way to a boulder problem that guards the real crack. There is an arete (outward facing corner) split by a thin crack, making for some interesting and involved climbing. At first the arete is fairly vertical, and the right side sticks out slightly from the left. Then the right side of the crack cuts off and becomes overhung and slick as you enter an endurance battle laybacking through a green camelot size.</p>
                        <p>I opted for a strategy of leaning far to the right, and placing my left heel high up on the edge created by the offset of the crack, taking some weight off my fingers at the expense of moving slower. Ethan preferred a more conventional style of lay-backing and trying to move through the hard sections fast.</p>
                        
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/scarface/p5.jpg" alt="Entering the crack on pitch 5" /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Entering the crack on pitch 5</span>
                        <p></p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/scarface/p5LookingDown.jpg" alt="Looking down from the top of pitch 5" /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Looking down from the top of pitch 5</span>
                        
                        <p>This crack on pitch 5 was only one of 5.12 two cruxes on the route, and since we knew we needed all the energy we could muster to finish the rest of the route, getting this pitch dialed was our first goal. So I would try to keep up on the mist trail, and we’d cruise through the first four pitches. Then we’d take turns giving attempts on pitch 5, making note of all the necessary foot placements, and which holds to grab with each hand. Once we were too tired we rappelled to the ground, and hiked back to our cars. After the first day of this I returned home so sore from the hike that I started doing stairmaster workouts with all of my gear on my back the next day to get in better shape.</p>
                        <p>Although I’m not sure that I can complain too much considering  how the mist trail used to be. The original approach to the Snow Hotel followed roughly the same path as the mist trial, with one large difference. Rather than cleanly blasted granite steps with a safety rail, surmounting Vernal falls involved a precariously steep and slippery wooden ladder that resulted in at least one death.</p>

                        <a href="#!"><img class="center" class="img-fluid" src="assets/scarface/mistTrailV1.jpg" alt="Original ladder system to climb Vernal Falls" /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Original ladder system to climb Vernal Falls</span>

                        <p>In the late 1800’s most trails were toll-trails, and so Anderson Spur set out to create a safer, shorter, and generally friendlier trail by staying to the north of the river. Many parts of the trail can still be seen and walked today, but he ran out of money and blasting powder before it was finished. Soon the Mist trail was upgraded to a slightly safer ladder system, before it was finally turned into what it is now.</p>

                        <p>After working pitch five we would rappel to the ground, and descend the mist trail, hungry for some In-N-Out. On one occasion we came across a group of hikers all in awe of something off the trail, with their phones out. I assumed it was just a squirrel, being capable of single handedly causing traffic jams on trails as everybody stops to photograph and feed them. I legitimately think it's funnier to watch other tourists watch the animals than just watching the animals themselves. Upon reaching the group we discovered that it was more than just an overly plump squirrel, but an adolescent bear grazing near the river.</p>
                        <p>Ethan and I, perhaps a bit more used to the wildlife, just stopped just long enough for Ethan to mutter loud enough for everyone to hear, “That one’s eating right now, so he’s hungry. I hope nobody has any food in those backpacks!” As we left, I glanced back to catch a sight of the now-frightened tourists debating the possibility of a bear attack.</p>
                   
                        <a href="#!"><img  class="img-fluid" src="assets/scarface/bear.jpg" alt="A bear" /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Large Squirrel</span>

                        <p>By the time we arrived at the base for our fourth consecutive weekend, we were confident enough to pull through pitch five without too much difficulty. Ethan led it, so it was a little harder for him as he had to place gear while climbing, and I would have the easier task of removing the gear on the way up. Our goal today would be to scout out the second crux, pitch 8.</p>
                        <p>Upon arriving at the top of pitch 5, I received my first glimpse of my next lead. It was a crack just slightly larger than a fist, meaning a completely different change of pace from the last pitch. Instead of clean fingers and toes, the wide crack required more of a blue-collar approach of using fists, elbows, knees, and sometimes your head to progress upwards. Although I never got close to falling, some light rain in the middle of my lead gave me a bit of a scare.</p>
                        <p>When we arrived at the base of the pitch 8 corner, I was a bit intimidated. It was overhung on one side, and the start of the crack didn’t open enough to allow more than your first knuckle for about 15 feet. That meant that right off the belay (the most dangerous section to fall because you can hit your belayer) I was pulling off three fingertips while struggling to place gear with the other. I gave it a first attempt with more than a few falls, and lowered to the belay. Amazingly, Ethan cruised the pitch his first try.</p>

                        <a href="#!"><img  class="img-fluid" src="assets/scarface/upperCrux.jpg" alt="Looking up at the p8 corner" /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Looking up at the pitch 8 corner</span>

                        <p> I gave a second burn to fine tune all my beta and memorize gear placements, so I didn’t waste time trying to figure it out on lead. Ethan gave me lots of helpful tips on how to relieve my hands of as much weight as possible by changing how I was placing my foot in the crack and pushing my right shoulder against the wall. After a rest, I started up my third attempt. I pulled through the lower crux smoothly, and reached the good rest that divides the pith in half. After catching my breath, I began the bouldery section of the corner that included some tricky stemming and face climbing, culminating in a reachy move from an undercling to a good hold. I grabbed the undercling, set my feet, and reached upwards. As I neared the final hold, my food slipped and I fell. Defeated, I lowered down to the belay, and told Ethan I didn’t think it would go that day.</p>
                        <p>Rather than agree, Ethan looked at me and said, “our goal today was to work this pitch for a future ascent. So I’m willing to support you in future attempts. But look, Adam, no pressure or anything, but if you free this today we don’t have to do that hike for a fifth time!” That was all the motivation I needed. So I rested for about 30 minutes, although I’m not sure that ‘rest’ is the right word for hanging in your harness, left side jammed against your partner, shivering slightly in the wind.Knowing that the mist trail stairs awaited failure, I calmed my nerves by eating a cliff bar and looking at the surrounding beauty.</p>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">A view of Nevada Falls from pitch 8</span>

                        <p>Once I felt confident again, I started up my fourth attempt. At the good rest, I was able to find a better foot that allowed me to go completely hands-free and get a better rest. I pulled through the bouldery section, and set my feet for the move that I had blown last time. I took an extra second to take a deep breath, then reached to the edge easily. I was elated, and nearly blew the last easy move! Ethan repeated the pitch for a second time to get back up, and we started towards the summit.</p>

                        <p>The rest of the route went well. Pitch 9 is a 5.11 that would have been no trouble on another day, but after climbing 5 pitches of 5.12 I had to put up quite a fight to onsight it. We reached the top as the sun was setting, and turned on our headlamps to meander down the steep backside of Liberty Cap. Upon reaching Vernal Falls we saw a sign noting a trail closure after 3pm. We didn’t want to do the muir trail descent (twice as long) and so assumed that no park ranger would be lurking in the bushes at midnight to give fines to lost hikers and worn-out climbers. We got back to our cars around one, and drove home for church the next morning. It was a long day, and so when I woke up the next morning I felt even more fatigued than I had after descending El Cap.</p>

                        <p>To me, it seems almost unfair how the rockfall that created such a beautiful route was at the same time a near catastrophe for those at the Snow hotel when it occurred.</p>
                        <p> The same way a rainstorm that provides hope for farmers and kayakers might also cause accidents on the freeway and delay sporting events, most everything that happens in this world has a two-fold effect. I think about the pandemic this same way: for me it was a time of freedom and adventure, but for others it meant losing work and loved-ones. While I don’t always know why God’s plans happen the way they do, I am incredibly grateful for all that came into place for me to share such an experience with Ethan that day.</p>
