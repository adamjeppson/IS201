        <h1>In Defense of Climbing Safety</h1>
        <h5>I love rock climbing, I've been doing it since I was a little kid, and started seriously pursuing the sport at the age of 15.</h5>
        <img src="assets/img/babyAdam.jpg" height="200px" alt="Me climbing as a kid">
        <p>At first I climbed mostly indoors in specific gyms for climbing. I had many peers willing to teach me and help me progress, for each of whom I am very grateful. Very quickly I started to want to climb outdoors, or real rocks. That meant leaning a host of new skills, like lead climbing and belaying, and building and cleaning sport anchors. I loved it. That wasn't enought though, pretty quickly I wanted to climb taller and more difficult walls. Once again, I had new skills to learn. Placing Trad gear, building gear anchors, multi-pitch techniques, etc. But I learned from experienced friends, and went little by little to avoid accident.</p>
        <p>Most of the time when I mentioned my climbing pursuits to others, They would make offhanded comments like, "isn't that dangerous?", or "I'm not brave enough for that". And I simply tell them "no".  The point of this rant is to justify the objective dangers of climbing, in contrast to the sweaty-palm-inducing steryotypes of climbing like in the movie Free Solo.</p>
        <p>In debates about the relative safety of climbing to other activities, I typically bring up the examples of driving on the freeway, where crashes are common. You can't drive for more than an hour without seeing at least one. However, I can climb for years and never witness an accident. Then people usually make the point that once you learn how to drive safely, it's easy to be safe. It's no different in climbing.</p>
        <p>Annually, around 30 people die rock climbing each year, worldwide. That's a relatively small percentage. Furthermore, 60% of all climbing accidents (not just fatalities) are caused by avoidable human error, mostly involving rapellng. While driving, you might be able to controll your own actions but are largely at the mercy of the skill of other drivers. In climbing (Strictly rock, and not ice and mountaineering) factors outside of your controll are relatively few: Earthquakes, rockfall, bad weather, faliure of gear.</p>
        <p>Gear doesn't just fail on it's own. It breaks because you don't learn how to use it properly. Ropes dont just break, it takes months of use and abrasion, and you can easily tell when a rope is getting in bad shape. Weather forecasts are available to all. In the cases of inadequate protection in graphs below, think of it like running out of gas. You should know how easily protected a route is before you start up it. If you're not confident in your ability to protect the route safely, don't do it! It's no different than thinking, "there's 200 miles to the next gas station after this one. My car says it can go 170 more. I don't want to stop at this one, so I'll hope I can make it." When you run out of gas, there is nothing to blame but yourself. If you learn how to climb safely, and learn how to get down safely, and always remain in a state of cautiousness, I am of the opinion that it is safer than driving on the freeway. Therefore, I invite you to explore the data below. You'll find that most accidents are user error.</p>
